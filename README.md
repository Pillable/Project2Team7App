# PillReminder

All code is in PillReminder/app/src/main/java/com/example/pillreminder/
It is well documented using kdoc style commenting and clearly displayed encapsulation and abstraction. 
Complex logic is abstracted away by classes such as the DataHandler class. 
In addition, all methods and instance variables that can be made private are made private.
